> [!IMPORTANT]
>
> **Please check the announcement for upgrade notes on version 2.0!**


<details>
    <summary>Announcement</summary>

## Pinned

1. If you encounter issues during deployment or usage, please carefully read the documentation, FAQ, and existing issues first.
2. **Note**: This repository is a remake of the [Telegraph-Image](https://github.com/cf-pages/Telegraph-Image) project. If you like this project, please support the original one as well.

## 2025.2.6 Version 2.0 Upgrade Notes

> The v2.0 version has been released, with many changes and optimizations compared to v1.0. However, the beta version may have potential instability. If you prefer stability, you may delay updating.
>
> Due to **changes in the build command**, this update requires **manual operation**. Please follow these steps:
>
> - Sync your forked repository to the latest version (ignore if already synced automatically)
> - Go to the Pages management page, enter `Settings` -> `Build`, edit the `Build configuration`, and set the `Build command` to `npm install`
> - All new version settings have been **migrated to the Admin Panel -> System Settings** interface, so generally no need to configure environment variables anymore. Settings made in the system settings interface will **override** environment variable settings. However, to ensure compatibility of images uploaded via the Telegram channel with the old version, **please keep any previously set Telegram-related environment variables!**
> - After confirming the above settings are correct, go to the Pages management page, enter `Deployments`, and `Retry` the last failed deployment.

## Notification About Switching to Telegram Channel

> Due to abuse of the telegraph image hosting, the upload channel has switched to Telegram Channel. Please **update to the latest version (see the last section of chapter 3.1 for update instructions)** and set `TG_BOT_TOKEN` and `TG_CHAT_ID` according to the deployment requirements in the documentation, otherwise upload functionality will not work.
>
> Also, the **KV database is now mandatory**; if not configured before, please configure it as per the documentation.
>
> For issues, please check section 5 FAQ first.

# 4. WebDAV Bridge Service

This project provides a powerful **WebDAV Bridge Cloudflare Worker** that allows you to access and manage hosted files through the standard WebDAV protocol.

## 4.1 Features

- üîí **Authentication**: Supports Basic Auth authentication with username/password
- üìÅ **Directory Browsing**: Complete directory structure display, supports both HTML pages and WebDAV clients
- üì§ **File Upload**: Upload files to specified directories using PUT method
- üóëÔ∏è **File Deletion**: Support for deleting individual files or entire folders
- üì• **File Download**: Direct file downloads with automatic proxy to upstream storage
- üåê **CORS Support**: Built-in CORS support ensuring proper web client access

## 4.2 Supported WebDAV Methods

| Method | Function | Description |
|--------|----------|-------------|
| `PROPFIND` | List directory contents | Get file and folder lists, supports WebDAV clients |
| `GET` | Download file/browse directory | File downloads or HTML directory browsing pages |
| `PUT` | Upload file | Upload files to specified paths and folders |
| `DELETE` | Delete file/folder | Support for deleting individual files or entire directories |
| `OPTIONS` | Protocol detection | Returns supported WebDAV methods and features |
| `MKCOL` | Create directory | Create new folders (automatically supported) |

## 4.3 Deployment Configuration

### 4.3.1 Environment Variables

Set the following environment variables in your Cloudflare Worker:

```bash
# WebDAV authentication credentials
AUTH_USER=your_username          # WebDAV login username
AUTH_PASS=your_password          # WebDAV login password

# Upstream API configuration
UPSTREAM_HOST=your-imgbed.domain.com  # Your image bed domain
API_TOKEN=your_api_token         # API access token
```

### 4.3.2 Custom Domain Binding (Recommended)

For a better user experience, it's highly recommended to bind a custom domain to your WebDAV Worker:

1. **Prepare Domain**: Ensure you have an available domain that is hosted on Cloudflare
2. **Add Custom Route**:
   - Go to Cloudflare Workers console
   - Select your WebDAV Worker
   - Click the `Triggers` tab
   - Click `Add Custom Domain`
   - Enter your subdomain, e.g.: `webdav.yourdomain.com`
   - Click `Add Domain`

3. **SSL Certificate**: Cloudflare will automatically provide a free SSL certificate for your custom domain

**Advantages of Using Custom Domain**:
- üåü **Better Compatibility**: Avoid limitations some WebDAV clients have with `.workers.dev` domains
- üîí **Enhanced Security**: Custom domains are generally more trusted by clients
- üì± **Mobile Friendly**: iOS/Android devices have better support for custom domains
- üéØ **Brand Consistency**: Use a unified domain system with your image hosting service

## 4.4 Usage

### Browser Access
Access the Worker address directly in your browser and enter authentication credentials to browse file directories:
```
# Using custom domain (recommended)
https://webdav.yourdomain.com/

# Or using default Worker domain
https://your-webdav-worker.your-subdomain.workers.dev/
```

### WebDAV Clients
You can use any WebDAV-compatible client to connect:

**Windows File Explorer**:
1. Open "This PC"
2. Right-click and select "Add a network location"
3. Enter the WebDAV Worker address
4. Enter username and password

**macOS Finder**:
1. Press `Cmd+K` in Finder
2. Enter WebDAV address (custom domain recommended):
   - `https://webdav.yourdomain.com` or
   - `https://your-webdav-worker.your-subdomain.workers.dev`
3. Enter authentication credentials

**Third-party Clients**:
- File managers like Cyberduck, WinSCP, FileZilla Pro
- Mobile: FE File Explorer, Documents by Readdle, etc.

## 4.5 Key Features

- **Smart Path Handling**: Automatic path processing with support for Chinese characters and special characters
- **Paginated Loading**: Large directories are automatically paginated for improved performance
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error handling with user-friendly error messages
- **Cache Optimization**: Proper browser caching utilization for improved access speed
- **Secure & Reliable**: Based on Cloudflare Worker edge computing with global acceleration

Through WebDAV Bridge, you can manage hosted files just like using a local folder, achieving a true "cloud drive" experience!
